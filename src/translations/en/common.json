		"first": "My programming journey started back in high school when I realized that HTML alone wasn't sufficient while creating a Guest Book. At first, I learned about PHP by making websites for\n                my school's teachers. Eventually, I got into frameworks,\n                starting with Code Igniter and later Symfony. But all along, I\n                could see that this approach wasn't flawless.",
		"second": "That's when I got the opportunity to work on a React project, and a few years later, on one with Angular. In both cases, I joined the project without prior knowledge of the framework. In\n                the near future, I plan to learn Vue, and further down the line,\n                I aim to explore Python by creating a more complex project.",
		"hobby": "After hours, I'm an almost professional photographer, I ride a bike, I dance Cuban salsa, and sometimes I play the guitar. When it rains, I take care of plants and seek attention from my cat"
